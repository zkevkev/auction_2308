## Iteration 1 - Items, Attendees & Auctions

Use TDD to create Item, Attendee, & Auction that will respond to the interaction pattern below:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/item'
#=> true
pry(main)> require './lib/auction'
#=> true
pry(main)> require './lib/attendee'
#=> true

pry(main)> item1 = Item.new('Chalkware Piggy Bank')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fbda98fa1b0 @bids={}, @name="Chalkware Piggy Bank">

pry(main)> item1.name
#=> "Chalkware Piggy Bank"

pry(main)> item2 = Item.new('Bamboo Picture Frame')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fbda91874f0 @bids={}, @name="Bamboo Picture Frame">

pry(main)> attendee = Attendee.new({name: 'Megan', budget: '$50'})
#=> #<Attendee:0x00007fbda913f038 @budget=50, @name="Megan">

pry(main)> attendee.name
#=> "Megan"

pry(main)> attendee.budget
#=> 50

pry(main)> auction = Auction.new
#=> #<Auction:0x00007fbda90f1cc0 @items=[]>

pry(main)> auction.items
#=> []

pry(main)> auction.add_item(item1)
pry(main)> auction.add_item(item2)

pry(main)> auction.items
#=> [#<Item:0x00007fbda98fa1b0 ...>, #<Item:0x00007fbda91874f0 ...>]

pry(main)> auction.item_names
#=> ["Chalkware Piggy Bank", "Bamboo Picture Frame"]
```

## Iteration 2 - Bidding!

Use TDD to update your classes to respond to the following interaction pattern.  Some notes:

- `unpopular_items` are those items which have no bids.
- `potential_revenue` is the total possible sale price of the items (the items highest bid)

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/item'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/auction'
#=> true

pry(main)> require './lib/attendee'
#=> true

pry(main)> item1 = Item.new('Chalkware Piggy Bank')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fdc07956ab0 @bids={}, @name="Chalkware Piggy Bank">

pry(main)> item2 = Item.new('Bamboo Picture Frame')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fdc07925280 @bids={}, @name="Bamboo Picture Frame">

pry(main)> item3 = Item.new('Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fdc071ab040 @bids={}, @name="Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies">

pry(main)> item4 = Item.new('2 Days Dogsitting')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fdc088fb6f0 @bids={}, @name="2 Days Dogsitting">

pry(main)> item5 = Item.new('Forever Stamps')
#=> #<Item:0x00007fdc071695f0 @bids={}, @name="Forever Stamps">

pry(main)> attendee1 = Attendee.new({name: 'Megan', budget: '$50'})
#=> #<Attendee:0x00007fdc088f0e08 @budget=50, @name="Megan">

pry(main)> attendee2 = Attendee.new({name: 'Bob', budget: '$75'})
#=> #<Attendee:0x00007fdc071131c8 @budget=75, @name="Bob">

pry(main)> attendee3 = Attendee.new({name: 'Mike', budget: '$100'})
#=> #<Attendee:0x00007fdc070e2190 @budget=100, @name="Mike">

pry(main)> auction = Auction.new
#=> #<Auction:0x00007fdc0799de60 @items=[]>

pry(main)> auction.add_item(item1)

pry(main)> auction.add_item(item2)

pry(main)> auction.add_item(item3)

pry(main)> auction.add_item(item4)

pry(main)> auction.add_item(item5)

pry(main)> item1.bids
#=> {}

pry(main)> item1.add_bid(attendee2, 20)

pry(main)> item1.add_bid(attendee1, 22)

pry(main)> item1.bids
#=> {
#     #<Attendee:0x00007fdc071131c8 ...> => 20,
#     #<Attendee:0x00007fdc088f0e08 ...> => 22
#   }

pry(main)> item1.current_high_bid
#=> 22

pry(main)> item4.add_bid(attendee3, 50)

pry(main)> auction.unpopular_items
#=> [#<Item:0x00007fdc07925280 ...>, #<Item:0x00007fdc071ab040 ...>, #<Item:0x00007fdc071695f0 ...>]

pry(main)> item3.add_bid(attendee2, 15)

pry(main)> auction.unpopular_items
#=> [#<Item:0x00007fdc07925280 ...>, #<Item:0x00007fdc071695f0 ...>]

pry(main)> auction.potential_revenue
#=> 87
```

## Iteration 3 - More bidding stuff!

Use TDD to update your classes to include the following functionality. You must complete at least 2 of the 3 methods to pass. If you have time, we suggest doing all 3.

Some notes:

- `bidder_info` should return a hash with keys that are attendees, and values that are a hash with that attendee's budget and an array of items that attendee has bid on.
- `close_bidding` should update the item so that it will not accept additional bids

| Method Name | Return Value |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `Auction#bidders` | Array of bidders' names as `String`; ex: ["Megan", "Bob", "Mike"] |
| `Auction#bidder_info` | `Hash` with the following format: key of `Attendee` object pointing to a value of a `Hash`. The sub-hash should have a key of `:budget` as a `Symbol` and value of their budget as an `Integer`. The sub-hash should have a second key of `:items` as a `Symbol` with a value that is an `Array` of items the attendee has bid on. See example below. |
| `Item#close_bidding` | Return value of your choice; ensure it follows the spec above such that closing the bidding on an item makes it so the item will no longer accept new bids. |

Example return value hash for `bidder_info`

```ruby
 # {
 #    #<Attendee:0x00007ff177a45108 @budget=50, @name="Megan"> =>
 #      {
 #        :budget => 50,
 #        :items => [#<Item:0x00007ff17702e2a0 ...>]
 #      },
 #    #<Attendee:0x00007ff17816a4b0 @budget=75, @name="Bob"> =>
 #      {
 #        :budget => 75,
 #        :items => [#<Item:0x00007ff17702e2a0...>, #<Item:0x00007ff177ae45f0 ...>]
 #      },
 #    #<Attendee:0x00007ff177a0f5f8 @budget=100, @name="Mike"> =>
 #      {
 #        :budget => 100,
 #        :items => [#<Item:0x00007ff177a9d858...>]
 #      }
 #   }
 ```

## Iteration 4 - Dates ! And closing the auction

Use TDD to update your classes to respond to the following interaction pattern.  Some notes:

- An Auction will now be created with a date - whatever date the event is created on through the use of `Date.today`. The addition of a date to the event should NOT break any previous tests.  The `date` method will return a string representation of the date - 'dd/mm/yyyy'. We want you to test this in with a date that is IN THE PAST. In order to test the date method in a way that will work today, tomorrow and on any date in the future, you will need to use a stub 🙂
- `close_auction` should close bidding and 'sell' items to attendees.  The method will return a hash with items as the keys, and the purchaser of that item as the values. Attendees will only purchase items that they can afford (their bid is less than their current budget).  If an attendee has bid on multiple items, they will purchase the items starting with the most expensive first, followed by the next most expensive, etc... while they still have enough money in their budget to pay for the item.  If the highest bidder for an item does not have enough budget to pay for the item, the next highest bidder will purchase the item.

| Method Name | Return Value |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `Auction#date` | `String` representation of the date in the "dd/mm/yyyy" format. Ex: "24/02/2020"  |
| `Auction#close_auction` | `Hash` with each `Item` object as a key pointing to a value of the `Attendee` object who won the item. Ensure your method follows the spec details above. Example hash below. |

Example return value hash for `close_auction`

```ruby
#=>
# {
#   #<Item:0x00007f9ea5af30c0 ...> => #<Attendee:0x00007f9ea50c4748 ...>,
#   #<Item:0x00007f9ea5a5a190 ...> => 'Not Sold',
#   #<Item:0x00007f9ea5910c08 ...> => #<Attendee:0x00007f9ea50c4748 ...>,
#   #<Item:0x00007f9ea5c08f00 ...> => #<Attendee:0x00007f9ea50b5b58 ...>,
#   #<Item:0x00007f9ea5bc0480 ...> => #<Attendee:0x00007f9ea5b73f40 ...>
# }
#
```
